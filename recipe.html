        <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>For extra fluffiness, let the batter rest for <mark>5-10 minutes</mark> before cooking. If the batter seems too thick, add a splash more milk, if too thin, add a tablespoon of flour. Also, mix in blueberries, chocolate chips or bananas to the batter for variety. Enjoy!</p>
